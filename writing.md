## Introduction

1. RLfD
* the definition of RLfD
* RLfD was inspired by instructor-learning patterns. 
* In this paper, we also draw on the human learning patterns and design learning engagement for robots

2. the learning engagement is important in instructor-learning paradigm. 
* The definition of learning engagement
* why the learning engagement is important

3. in a interactive human learning, how human show learning engagement. attentions vs. mimics
* attention
* mimic: usually with some delay

4. learning behaviors: attention and mimc; challenging
* attention: automatically generate attention point; body pose based
* mimic: mimic with robot behavior constraints; delay design

## Related work
1. RLfD: 
* types
* algorithms
* research gaps: the robot learning engagement

2. Robot engagement
* many ways: attention is the most important one; how to show attention and why it is insufficient
* mimic: robot show mimic behaviors; 

## Methods
1. Body poses
2. Instant attention
3. Approximately mimic with delay

## Evaluation
1. Simulation environment
* pepper and actor
* mocap data retargetting
* sports type

2. Questions 
* manipulations 
* other questions

3. Pilot study results
* robot showing engagement is necessary
* some problems: distance between robot and human; the time delay

4. Second-round study
* system performance
* quantitively analysis
* qualitively analysis
