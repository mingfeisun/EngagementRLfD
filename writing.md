# Introduction

### RLfD
* the definition of RLfD
* RLfD was inspired by instructor-learning patterns. algorithms 
* In this paper, we also draw on the human learning patterns and design learning engagement for robots

### the learning engagement is important in instructor-learning paradigm. 
* The definition of learning engagement
* why the learning engagement is important: to guide the instructor; to influence the learning development

### in a interactive human learning, how human show learning engagement. attentions vs. mimics
* social interaction: attentional engagement
* mimic: usually with some delay

### learning behaviors: attention and mimc; challenging
* attention: automatically generate attention point; body pose based
* mimic: mimic with robot behavior constraints; delay design

### contribution of this work
* attention --> instant attention
* mimic --> approximately mimic with delay

* research gaps: the robot learning engagement

### Robot engagement
* many ways: attention is the most important one; how to show attention and why it is insufficient
* mimic: robot show mimic behaviors; 

# Methods
### Body poses
### Instant attention
### Approximately mimic with delay

# Evaluation
### Simulation environment
* pepper and actor
* mocap data retargetting

### Questions 
* manipulations 
* other questions

### Pilot study results
* robot showing engagement is necessary
* some problems: distance between robot and human; the time delay

### Second-round study
* system performance
* quantitively analysis
* qualitively analysis
