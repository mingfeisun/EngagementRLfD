# Introduction

### RLfD
* the definition of RLfD
* RLfD was inspired by instructor-learning patterns. algorithms 
* In this paper, we also draw on the human learning patterns and design learning engagement for robots

### the learning engagement is important in instructor-learning paradigm. 
* The definition of learning engagement: two types of engagement behaviors (attention and imitation)
* to indicate the learners' internal status
* to guide the instructor
* why the learning engagement is important: to guide the instructor; to influence the learning development

### a challenging problem
* the attention design: rule-based; not related to body motions
* the imitation design: physical constraints; delay effects

### contribution of this work
* attention --> instant attention
* mimic --> approximately mimic with delay

* algorithms
* research gaps: the robot learning engagement

### Robot engagement
* the definition of engagement; 
* how to show engagement: attention, imitation, others (spatial)
* attention: how to generate attention; visual saliency, specifc objects, predefined events
* imitation: two types of robot behaviors (imitation or emulation); imitation(mimicry in engagement), robot show mimic behaviors; emulation (show the same results), not the focus of this paper; imitation with constraints, time delay

# Methods
### Body poses
### Instant attention
### Approximately mimic with delay

# Evaluation
### Simulation environment
* the contents (pepper and actor), why simulation
* overview of the simulation: two parts (demonstration control and robot behavior manipulation); 
* sports and why
* implementation details

### System performances
* attention generation results + robot imitation results
* how to evaluate the results: subjects' reported ratings, baseline: robot with none
* ~~running time analysis, how to compare? baseline?~~

### User study
* user study design
* questions: engagement, master, acceptable, intelligence, demonstration
* feedback: analysis

### Discussion
* robot showing engagement is necessary
* limitations:
* some problems: distance between robot and human; the time delay
